/**
 * PurchaseDate class. A date has a year, month and day, all numbers.
 * A date cannot be invalid, meaning that the year cannot be
 * later than the current year and the day and month must fall
 * within valid ranges. This class does not take into account
 * months with varying numbers of days.
 * <p>
 * NOTE TO STUDENTS: This class uses a private "helper" method that
 * takes a date component (int) as its parameter and returns a String
 * consisting of the date component padded with a leading zero if appropriate.
 * This extra method was not required in the assignment, but was added
 * to avoid writing the same code in two different places.
